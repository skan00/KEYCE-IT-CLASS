    <p class="class">Anoaʻi signed a contract with WWE in 2010 and was later assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).[20] He made his televised debut on August 19, 2010, using the ring name Roman Leakee, in a 15-man battle royal, which was won by Alex Riley.[30] On the January 16, 2011 episode of FCW, Leakee was a competitor in a 30-man Grand Royal, but was eliminated.[31] Later in 2011, Leakee formed a tag team with Donny Marlow and the pair unsuccessfully challenged Calvin Raines and Big E Langston for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on July 8.[32]

        In January 2012, Leakee pinned FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion Leo Kruger in a non-title match.[33] On the February 5 episode of FCW, he defeated Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match to become the number one contender to the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.[34] He failed to win the championship when he lost to Kruger the following week.[35] Leakee later won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship with Mike Dalton[36][37] and would drop the titles to CJ Parker and Jason Jordan shortly after.[38]
        
        After WWE rebranded FCW to NXT in August 2012,[39] Anoaʻi, with the new ring name Roman Reigns and a villainous character, made his debut on the October 31 episode of NXT by defeating CJ Parker.

    <p>Roman Reigns made his main roster television debut as on November 18, 2012, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, assaulting Ryback during the triple threat main event for the WWE Championship, allowing CM Punk to retain the title, thus establishing themselves as villains.[41] The trio declared themselves The Shield and vowed to rally against "injustice", while also denying working for Punk, even though they would routinely emerge from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries, including Ryback and WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane).[42][43][44][45] This led to a six-man tag team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 16, in which Reigns, Ambrose and Rollins defeated Team Hell No and Ryback in their debut match.[46] The Shield continued to aid Punk in January 2013, attacking both Ryback and The Rock.[47][48] On the January 28 episode of Raw, it was revealed that Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for them.[49]

        The Shield then indistinctly ended their association with Punk while beginning a feud with John Cena, Ryback and Sheamus that directed to a six-man tag match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, which The Shield won.[50][51] The Shield then made their WrestleMania debut, where they defeated Sheamus, Randy Orton and Big Show at WrestleMania 29 in April.[52][53] The following night on Raw, The Shield attempted to attack The Undertaker, but they were stopped by Team Hell No.[54] This set up a six-man tag team match on the April 22 episode of Raw, which The Shield won.[55] On the May 13 episode of Raw, The Shield's undefeated streak in televised six-man tag team matches ended in a disqualification loss in an elimination tag team match against Cena, Kane and Bryan.

    <h2 id="personallife">Personal life</h2>
    <p>In early 2005, while studying at Georgia Institute of Technology, Anoaʻi met and began dating Galina Becker.[311] They were married in December 2014,[312] and reside in Tampa, Florida.[313] Their first child, a daughter, was born in December 2007 and appeared with Anoaʻi in a PSA in June 2014.[314][315][316][317] They had twin sons in November 2016, followed by another set of twin sons in March 2020.[318][319]

        At a house show on December 30, 2015, Anoaʻi had his nose legitimately broken during his match against Sheamus,[320][321] and later underwent nasal reconstructive surgery which altered the appearance of his nose.[322]
        
        In 2019, Anoaʻi shared that he had been living with chronic myeloid leukemia, an incurable but treatable form of blood cancer. He was diagnosed in 2007 during his American Football career and continues lifelong medication to manage the condition.</p>

    <p>
        On February 25, 2019, Reigns made his return to Raw, revealing that his leukemia was once again in remission to a huge ovation from the crowd. Later in the night, Reigns and Rollins would appear to assist Ambrose from an attack by Drew McIntyre, Bobby Lashley, Elias, and Baron Corbin.[205] The following week on Raw, Ambrose assisted Reigns and Rollins from another attack by the four, before the trio performed their signature pose, officially reuniting the group for the third time.[206] The Shield defeated the team of McIntyre, Lashley, and Corbin at Fastlane on March 10.[207] On the March 25 episode of Raw, Reigns accepted a challenge from McIntyre for a match at WrestleMania 35.[208] At the event on April 7, Reigns was successful in defeating McIntyre.

        In November, Reigns began a feud with King Corbin and his allies Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode.[229] Reigns was named team captain for SmackDown at Survivor Series on November 24,[230] where he and his four teammates defeated Team Raw and Team NXT in a five-on-five-on-five tag team elimination match. During the match, Corbin caused Mustafa Ali to be eliminated. Reigns responded by spearing Corbin and allowing him to be eliminated.[231] This led to a tables, ladders, and chairs match being arranged for the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view on December 15,[232] which Reigns lost after interference from Ziggler and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson).[233] At the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020, Reigns defeated Corbin in a falls count anywhere match, after receiving assistance from The Usos. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match, but was the last competitor eliminated by the eventual winner Drew McIntyre.[234] At Super ShowDown on February 27, Reigns defeated Corbin in a steel cage match to end their feud.
