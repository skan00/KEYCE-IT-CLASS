      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy" target="_blank"><strong>Yajurveda</strong></a> is broadly grouped into two – the "black" or "dark" (Krishna) <strong>Yajurveda and the "white" or "bright" (Shukla) Yajurveda</strong>. The term "black" implies "the un-arranged, unclear, motley collection" of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the "white" which implies the "well arranged, clear" <i>Yajurveda.[5] The black Yajurveda has survived in four recensions, while two recensions of white Yajurveda have survived into the modern time</i></p>

      <h2 class="class"id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
      <p id="p2">Yajurveda is a compound Sanskrit word, composed of ya jus <span id="new">(यजुस्) </span>and Veda (वेद). Monier-Williams translates yajus as "religious reverence, veneration, worship, sacrifice, a sacrificial prayer, formula, particularly mantras uttered in a peculiar manner at a sacrifice".[13] Veda means "knowledge". Johnson states yajus means "(mostly) prose formulae or mantras, contained in the Yajur Veda, which are muttered"</p>
      <h3 class="class" id="date">Dating and historical context
      </h3>
      <p>The core text of the Yajurveda falls within the classical Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit at the end of the 2nd millennium BCE – younger than the Rigveda, and roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda, the Rigvedic Khilani, and the Sāmaveda.[17] The scholarly consensus dates the bulk of the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda hymns to the early Indian Iron Age, after c. 1200 and before 800 BCE.</p>
      <h2 id="upanishad">Upanishads</h2>
      <p>The Yajurveda has six primary Upanishads embedded within it</p>
      <h3 id="briha">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</h3>
      <p>The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is found in the White Yajurveda.[5] It is one of the Mukhya Upanishads, and among the largest and oldest as well (~700 BCE).[10]<br>It is a key scripture of Hinduism that has influenced all schools of Hindu philosophy. <br>The text is a treatise on Ātman (Soul, Self), with passages on metaphysics, ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars.[55][56][57]
      
      The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is among the earliest extensive discussions of the Hindu concept of dharma, karma and moksha (liberation from sorrow, freedom, emancipation, self-realization). Paul Deussen calls it, "unique in its richness and warmth of presentation", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.[58] Max Muller illustrated its style as follows,
      
      But when he [Self] fancies that he is, as it were, a god,
      or that he is, as it were, a king,
      or "I am this altogether," that is his highest world,
      This indeed is his (true) form, free from desires, free from evil, free from fear.
      
      Now as a man, when embraced by a beloved wife,
      knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within,
      thus this person, when embraced by the Prajna (conscious, aware) Self,
      knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within.
      This indeed is his (true) form, in which his wishes are fulfilled,
      in which the Self only is his wish, in which no other wish is left,
      he is free from any sorrow.

      <h2 id="manuscripts">Manuscripts and translations
      </h2>
      <p>Most surviving manuscripts and recensions of Yajurveda's Samhitas, Aranyakas and Brahmanas remain untranslated into Western languages. The two reliable translations are from British India colonial era, and have been widely studied.[79] These are AB Keith's translation of Taittiriya Samhita of the Black Yajurveda,[80] and Juliu Eggeling's translation of Satapatha Brahmana of the White Yajurveda.[54]</p>
      
      <p>Ralph Griffith published an early translation of White Yajurveda Samhita.[81] However, Frits Staal has questioned his translations and considers them "fantasies and best discarded".[82]</p>
      
      <p>Devi Chand published a re-interpreted translation of Yajurveda in 1965, reprinted as 3rd edition in 1980, wherein the translation incorporated Dayananda Saraswati's monotheistic interpretations of the Vedic text, and the translation liberally adds "O Lord" and "the Creator" to various verses, unlike other translators</p>
