          <p class="capital"> The coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating
            effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[2] The seeds
            of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.</p>
        <p>
          The beans are roasted and then ground into
          fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot,
          although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French
          press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter
          taste or enhance the flavor.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, a 9th-century Ethiopian
          goatherd, first observed the coffee plant after seeing his flock energized by chewing on the plant.[3] This legend does not appear
          before 1671, first being related by Antoine Faustus Nairon, a Maronite professor of Oriental languages and author of one of the
          first printed treatises devoted to coffee, De Saluberrima potione Cahue seu Cafe nuncupata Discurscus (Rome, 1671), indicating the
          story is likely apocryphal.[10][11][3] Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Starving after being
          exiled from Mokha, Omar found berries. After attempting to chew and roast them, Omar boiled them, which yielded a liquid that
          revitalized and sustained him.

        <h2>BIOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
          The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve (قهوه),
          borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah (قَهْوَة).[6] Medieval Arab lexicographers traditionally held that the etymology of qahwah
          meant 'wine', given its distinctly dark color, and was derived from the verb qahiya (قَهِيَ), 'to have no appetite'.[7] The word
          qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the brew or the bean; qahwah is not the name of the bean, which are known in
          Arabic as bunn and in Cushitic languages as būn. Semitic languages had the root qhh, 'dark color', which became a natural
          designation for the beverage. Its cognates include the Hebrew qehe(h) ('dulling') and the Aramaic qahey ('give acrid taste
          to').[7] Although etymologists have connected it with a word meaning "wine", it is also thought to be from the Kaffa region of
          Ethiopia.

        <h2>PROCESSING</h2>
        <h3>ROASTING</h3>
        <p>
          Of the two main species grown, arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is generally more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from C.
          canephora). Robusta coffee tends to be bitter and has less flavor but a better body than arabica. For these reasons, about
          three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica.[41] Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than
          arabica.[56] Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good
          quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known
          as crema).

        <h3>GRADING ROASTED BEANS</h3>
        <p>
          Coffee berries are traditionally selectively picked by hand, which is labor-intensive as it involves the selection of only the
          berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless
          of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two types of method—a dry process method
          which is often simpler and less labor-intensive, and a wet process method, which incorporates batch fermentation, uses larger
          amounts of water in the process, and often yields a milder coffee
